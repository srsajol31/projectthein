										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Certification of Wi-Fi 7, the cutting-edge wireless networking standard designed for home, enterprise, and industrial environments, is on track for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2024. As per the Wi-Fi Alliance, Wi-Fi Certified 7, based on IEEE 802.11be technology, will be accessible by Q1 2024, facilitating global interoperability and ushering in advanced Wi-Fi performance for the next generation of connected devices.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 7 devices are already entering the market, promising dramatically increased speeds compared to Wi-Fi 6 and 6E. Kristen Hanich, an analyst with Parks Associates, notes Wi-Fi 7&#8217;s key feature is its support for extremely high throughput, reaching speeds up to 46 Gbps, a substantial leap from Wi-Fi 6E&#8217;s 10 Gbps.</p>
<p>Among the anticipated features of Wi-Fi 7 is multi-link operation (MLO), addressing spectrum congestion challenges by significantly improving spectrum efficiency. This innovation allows dynamic connections to multiple bands, providing a more flexible and efficient user experience.</p>
<p>The new standard also opens access to the recently released 6 GHz band, effectively doubling the available spectrum in the U.S. Wi-Fi 7 is poised to overcome spectrum congestion challenges and further accelerate the evolution of wireless connectivity.</p>
<p>While Wi-Fi 6 and 6E have seen rapid adoption, Wi-Fi 7&#8217;s unique features, including enhanced bandwidth and dynamic band switching, position it to gain rapid traction. Andrew Spivey from ABI Research notes that Wi-Fi 7&#8217;s demand is driven by the need for additional network capacity, particularly in applications such as augmented and virtual reality.</p>
<p>As the market gears up for the Wi-Fi 7 era, it&#8217;s important to note that widespread adoption typically takes two to three years, influenced by factors like device availability, perceived benefits, and marketing efforts. Wi-Fi 7 is set to revolutionize connectivity, offering an unprecedented leap in speed, efficiency, and reliability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the realm of sustainable transportation, the partnership between Honda and GM in developing hydrogen cars, Toyota&#8217;s unwavering support for hydrogen technology, and the prospect of retrofitting traditional gas engines for hydrogen use have sparked discussions on the future viability of electric vehicles (EVs).</p>
<p>Despite the existence of conversion kits in Europe for transforming gas-powered cars into hydrogen, their limited adoption due to reliability issues has been evident. Converted gas engines have often proved less dependable compared to the more reliable performance of electric cars equipped with hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
<p>Toyota introduces a unique hydrogen engine designed for enhanced reliability compared to converted gas engines, offering an alternative to the prevalent fuel cell approach. However, the primary challenge both hydrogen and electric vehicles face is the lack of a robust infrastructure, with hydrogen generators being expensive.</p>
<p>The debate between hydrogen and electric cars centers on the attributes of an electric vehicle combined with the extended lifespan of hydrogen tanks. Yet, the critical hurdle for hydrogen-powered vehicles is the scarcity of refueling stations. In contrast, the electric vehicle ecosystem has rapidly expanded, with over 53,000 charging locations in the U.S. alone by 2022.</p>
<p>Home hydrogen fueling encounters its own challenges, requiring electricity, water, and expensive generators, making it a less feasible option compared to electric charging. The cost of hydrogen fueling further presents a barrier, with electric cars offering a more cost-effective <a href="https://www.technewsworld.com/">solution</a>.</p>
<p>While projections suggest an increase in hydrogen fueling stations by 2030, the disparity in availability and cost with electric charging stations remains significant. The feasibility of home hydrogen fueling is hampered by high costs and complexity.</p>
<p>As technology advances, battery-powered electric vehicles, supported by a growing charging infrastructure, are approaching the advantages of traditional gas cars in terms of fueling locations. Despite Toyota&#8217;s efforts in hydrogen technology, the cost and limited infrastructure might hinder its widespread adoption.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the evolving landscape of eco-friendly transportation highlights the challenges and opportunities for both hydrogen and electric vehicles. The crucial factor in determining their success lies in the development of an extensive and affordable infrastructure, a task that remains a considerable undertaking.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Product of the Week: Microlino Electric Car</strong></p>
<p>For local driving, the Microlino electric car from Switzerland stands out as an affordable and efficient option. With an impressive range and compact design, it caters to urban commuting needs. The car&#8217;s unique features, including a front door for easy access and Level 1 charging capability, make it an appealing choice for short-distance travel. While not available in the U.S. yet, the Microlino represents innovation in eco-friendly transportation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has announced its decision to discontinue the Facebook News tab in the UK, France, and Germany. This move has sparked discussions about the implications for news accessibility and the future of digital journalism. In this article, we will delve into the reasons behind Meta&#8217;s decision and explore its potential impact on the dissemination of news and information in these countries.</p>
<p><strong>Meta&#8217;s Reasoning and Wider Strategy:</strong> Meta explained in a blog post that its decision to shut down the Facebook News tab stems from the observation that users primarily visit the platform for social interactions, not for news consumption. The company stated that news content makes up less than 3% of what people see in their Facebook feeds. This suggests that Meta is refocusing its platform&#8217;s strategy towards fostering personal connections and community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on News Accessibility:</strong> The closure of the Facebook News tab raises concerns about the accessibility of news for users in the affected countries. Critics argue that Facebook has become a significant source of news for many people, especially those who may not actively seek out news from traditional media outlets. The removal of the News tab could potentially limit users&#8217; exposure to diverse and reliable news sources.</p>
<p><strong>Implications for Digital Journalism:</strong> Meta&#8217;s decision has also drawn attention to the complex relationship between tech platforms and news organizations. Some media outlets have expressed concerns that the shutdown of the News tab could adversely affect their digital revenue streams. Additionally, there are worries that the move could further concentrate power in the hands of a few large tech companies that control the distribution of news content online.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> Meta&#8217;s decision to discontinue Facebook News in the UK, France, and Germany underscores the evolving nature of the digital media landscape. It remains to be seen how this move will impact news consumption patterns and the sustainability of digital journalism. Stakeholders, including Meta, news organizations, and policymakers, will need to work together to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this changing landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Meta&#8217;s decision to shut down the Facebook News tab in select European countries has sparked debates about news accessibility, digital journalism, and the role of tech platforms in the dissemination of information. The implications of this move are multifaceted and require careful consideration. As the digital media landscape continues to evolve, finding sustainable and responsible ways to ensure access to diverse and reliable news sources remains a critical challenge for the industry.</p>
